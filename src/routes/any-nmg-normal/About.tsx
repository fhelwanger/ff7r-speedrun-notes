        First Strike

      <Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
        For this route to work it's mandatory to get First Strike in Chapter 4,
        which you get by completing "The Stagger Effect Pt.1" battle intel. To
        do it you must fill an ATB bar using any "triangle" move (Punisher,
        Overcharge, Whirl) when the enemy is staggered 10 times. Sometimes the
        passive ATB gain will "steal" a bar from you, so pay attention. If you
        follow the instructions for the fights you should be able to get it.
        Those are the enemies where you can do it:
      </Typography>
      <ul className={classes.list}>
        {enemies.map((enemy, enemyIndex) => (
          <li key={enemyIndex}>{enemy}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>

  );
}

function AtbBoost() {
  const classes = useStyles();

  const enemies = [
    "Security Officer (Chapter 1 after fence or escape, Chapter 2/4)",
    "Elite Security Officer (Johnny fight)",
    "Grenadier (Chapter 4)",
    "Elite Grenadier (Chapter 4)",
    "Riot Trooper (Chapter 4)",
    "Shock Trooper (Chapter 1)",
    "Guard Dog (Chapter 1)",
    "Monodrive (Chapter 1 first Barret fight or after Scorpion)",
    "Sentry Ray (Chapter 1)",
    "Sweeper (Chapter 1)",
    "The Huntsman",

        ATB Boost
      </Typography>
      <Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
        Similiarly, we also need to buy ATB Boost in Chapter 4 by completing
        "The Stagger Effect Pt.2" battle intel. For this you need to stagger 15
        different enemy types until the end of Chapter 4. If you follow the
        instructions for the fights you should be able to get it. The list is
        the following:
      </Typography>
      <ul className={classes.list}>
        {enemies.map((enemy, enemyIndex) => (
          <li key={enemyIndex}>{enemy}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

  return (
    <>
      <Typography variant="h5" paragraph>
        ATB Assist
      </Typography>
      <Typography className={classes.paragraph} paragraph>
        We also buy two materias from Chadley in chapter 14 that can be missed.
        One of them is ATB Assist. To get this materia you need to complete the
        "Refocus Analysis" battle intel which is done by using Refocus two
        times. One of them is in chapter 10 on the 3 Sahagins fight. Be careful
        that the Refocus animation should end for it to count. The other is in
        chapter 13 on Failed Experiment. If you miss it on the Sahagins fight,
        equip Refocus on Barret and use Blizzara All on the three Wererats at
        the start of his solo section in Chapter 13.

        ATB Stagger
      </Typography>
      <Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
        The other materia that we buy in chapter 14 is ATB Stagger, which is
        done by completing "The Stagger Effect Pt.4" battle intel. It's similar
        to ATB Boost, but this time we need to stagger 40 different enemy types.
        The list is the same as ATB Boost plus the following:
      </Typography>
      <ul className={classes.list}>
        {enemies.map((enemy, enemyIndex) => (

        ))}
      </ul>
      <Typography className={classes.paragraph}>
        If you missed any or are not sure, here are some quick backups to get
        additional staggers:
      </Typography>
      <ul className={classes.list}>
        {backupEnemies.map((enemy, enemyIndex) => (

        I wrote these notes but a lot of the strats and route listed here are

        I only said some key points of some members there but everyone helped a
