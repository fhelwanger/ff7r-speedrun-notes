        The notes are divided in sections. For example, some sections for
        encounters, for bosses, shops, menus, etc. The color at the beginning of
        each section indicates its type. If you open the menu in the left side
        you can select which sections to include to remove clutter, for example,
        if you don't want information about normal encounters. The colors are
        the following:

      <Typography>
        I didn't include cutscene skips in the notes because after running the
        game a couple of times I found it to be too much information, which made
        the notes harder to follow. So I believe it's something that is better
        learned by just running the game. That said, here are some tips about
        cutscene skipping:
      </Typography>
      <List dense>
        {tips.map((tip, tipIndex) => (
          <ListItem key={tipIndex}>

        First Strike
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        For this route to work it's mandatory to get First Strike in Chapter 4.
        To do it you must fill an ATB bar using any "triangle" move (Punisher,
        Overcharge, Whirl) when the enemy is staggered. Sometimes the passive
        ATB gain will "steal" a bar from you, so pay attention. If you follow
        the instructions for the fights you should be able to get it. Those are
        the enemies where you can do it:
      </Typography>
      <List dense>
        {enemies.map((enemy, enemyIndex) => (
          <ListItem key={enemyIndex}>
            <ListItemText primary={enemy} />
